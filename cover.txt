I am using Flask for this task.

In order to run it please use virtual env "source bin/activate"
and run the dependencies "pip -r requirements.txt".

Geevent and grequests are requiere for parallel request async. 
Request library is used for simplier Api calls. 

Normally I will make another shared library for the api request to resuse them.
The jinja template filter is used for making a nice date when rendering.
